## Brief Summary
To be a succesful Airbnb host (I mean if you want to attact more guests than other hosts), follow three suggestions below.

1. Offering affordable prices: 'Staying Fee', 'Cleaning Fee'
2. Preventing hosts from sudden cancellation and any property damage by clarifying these features: 'Extra People Fee', 'Cancellation Policy', 'House Rules'
3. Do your best on the basic stuff: 'Response Rate', 'Host Verification', 'Host Acceptance', 'Total Available Days'
