## Brief Summary
To be a succesful Airbnb host (I mean if you want to attact more guests than other hosts), follow three suggestions below.

1. Discouting the `Staying Fee` and `Cleaning Fee`
- The 80 percentile group offers the lower prices of staying fee and cleaning fee compared to 20 percentile group.

2. Holding a strict `Cancellation Policy` and `House Rules`, and clarifying `Extra People Fee`
- The 80 percentile group tends to have strict cancellation policy, house rules and extra people fee. It could prevent hosts from any loss in business  like sudden cancellation and any damages on their property.

3. Do your best on the basic stuff like `Response Rate`, `Host Verification`, `Host Acceptance`, `Total Available Days`
- The 80 percentile group are always better at features like 'response rate', 'host verification', 'host acceptance', and 'total available days` than the opposite group.
